Mini-project: Baby Names

The 3 "Tableau" visualisations can be accessed by downloading the "Data_vis.twbx" file and opening it via "Tableau Desktop 2022.1.1".
The file is composed of several dashboards and sheets, organized by a color code.
  * green : the 3 dashboards
  * blue : the sheets used to generate the dashboards
  * pink : other ideas

The sketches are in the folder : https://github.com/nicolasgallay/IGR204_mini_project_1/tree/main/Sketches

Hereunder, the description of why we believe these visualisation answer the questions of the project.

## Visualization 1  
How do baby names evolve over time? Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? Are there trends in time?



## Visualization 2
Is there a regional effect in the data? Are some names more popular in some regions? Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?


## Visualization 3
Are there gender effects in the data? Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently? (Note: this data set treats sex as binary; this is a simplification that carries into this assignment but does not generally hold.)
